# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook (Panaversity Hackathon Project)

This repository hosts the interactive AI-native textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, developed as part of the Panaversity Hackathon.

## Project Overview

This textbook aims to bridge the gap between digital AI brains and physical humanoid bodies, offering a comprehensive and practical learning experience. The frontend is built with Docusaurus v3, configured for automated deployment to GitHub Pages. The project adheres to strict principles of technical accuracy, ethical AI development, and a co-learning pedagogy.

## Quick Start (Frontend - Docusaurus)

To get started with local development:

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the local development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This will open the textbook in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Build the static site**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command generates static content into the `build` directory for deployment.

## Deployment Status

[![GitHub Pages Deploy Status](https://github.com/HumaizaNaz/new-book/actions/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HumaizaNaz/new-book/actions/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml)

Changes pushed to the `main` branch are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## Backend (UV Setup)

The `spec-kit/backend/` directory is designated for UV (fast Python package manager) related configurations and potential backend services/agents. Further details will be elaborated in future specifications.
